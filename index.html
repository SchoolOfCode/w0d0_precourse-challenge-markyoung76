                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1934</strong> | Born on 29th August in Krugersdorp, Transvaal, South Africa.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1944</strong> | He and his family relocate to Northern Rhodesia (now known as Zambia). His journey into martial arts begins; he starts training in kung fu, judo and boxing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1950</strong> | At 16, Northern Rhodesia select him to represent them in their rugby squad.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1951</strong> | By 17, Arneil had already earned his black belt in judo and had also been practising kenp≈ç and karate. During these years he moved to Durban, South Africa, for tertiary studies in mechanical engineering. Around the harbour area where he lived, he would often ask people to join him at his training dojo (training hall).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1959</strong> | Arneil departs from South Africa and goes to live in Southeast Asia; en route travelling to China, South Korea and Hong Kong before eventually settling in Japan. He continues to extend his knowledge in the martial arts by training in Shotokan, Wado-ryu, and Goju-ryu (under the guidance of master Gogen Yamaguchi).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1961</strong> | In January that year, Arneil began to study Kyokushin karate under Masutatsu Oyama, through Donn Draeger; who was a pioneer of international judo in the U.S. and Japan. He also found Oyama though Yamaguchi and others mentioning the name to him.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1962-63</strong> | Under the strict temperament and watchful eyes of Oyama, Arneil was promoted to the rank of 1st dan in Kyokushin karate on 15th May and only one year later, in 1963, he had managed to achieve his 2nd dan under the same guidance; a remarkable achievement by any standards.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1964</strong> | Oyama went on to 'adopt' Arneil to allow him to marry a Japanese woman; his wife, Tsuyuko Arneil. Also, by this stage Arneil was reported to have trained on a daily basis for an average time of around 6 hours.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1965</strong> | On 22nd May, Arneil completed the 100-man kumite (fight or sparring). He was the very next person to do so after Oyama himself succeeded the extremely difficult and highly-esteemed challenge. It took him approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes to complete and on 10th July he was further promoted to become a 3rd dan black belt. Oyama requested that Arneil should travel to the United Kingdom and promote the art of Kyokushin karate. He and his wife did so and by later that year, Arneil and Bob Boulton had co-founded the British Karate Kyokushinkai (BKK) organisation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1966</strong> | The BKK's first full-time dojo was opened in Stratford, east London. In May 1966, Arneil received promotion to the rank of 4th dan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1968-76</strong> | From 1968 onwards he was the Team Manager and Coach for the All Styles English and British Karate team. In 1975/76, they became the first non-Japanese team to win the karate World Championship. During this same period of time, Arneil was promoted to 5th dan on 15th January 1968 and to 6th dan on 7th October 1974. Also the French Karate Federation awarded him the title of "World's Best Coach" in 1975.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1977</strong> | On 6th August, Arneil was promoted again to the rank of 7th dan in Kyokushin karate.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1991</strong> | Around the time of Kyokushin's 5th World Tournament, Arneil and the BKK decided to resign from the IKO (International Karate Organisation, founded by Oyama in 1964), but Arneil went on to establish his own karate organisation, the IFK (International Federation of Karate - Kyokushin). The reasons he left are documented as being for adverse political and financial issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>1992</strong> | On 30th May, the British karate community awarded Arneil the rank of 8th dan black belt for his services to karate in the United Kingdom.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>2001</strong> | On 26th May, IFK country representatives awarded Arneil his 9th dan at their meeting in Berlin.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>2011</strong> | On 23rd July, Arneil was awarded the very prestigious 10th Dan at the 3rd IFK U-18's 
                            World Tournament by the IFK. This was as recognition for his unwavering commitment to Kyokushin Karate.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>2021</strong> | Hanshi Steve Arneil was life-President of the BKK and President of the IFK until January 
                            2021 when he handed the IFK presidency to Shihan David Pickthal. Very sadly he also died only a few months later on July 2nd, leaving behind his huge legacy to martial arts in general, but predominantly to those within the Kyokushin karate community.</li>

                            "It is his wish that differences be seized upon as an opportunity to see other points of view through the common bond of Kyokushin, there being no need for the empty vision of acrimony."
