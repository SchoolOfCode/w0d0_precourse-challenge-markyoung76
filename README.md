# **Hanshi Steve Arneil: Tribute Page**
## Introduction
Hi and welcome to my very first School of Code: National Bootcamp (pre-course) assignment.  

This task was to include the HTML and CSS code we had explored within [FreeCodeCamp's - Responsive Web Design Certification - 'Build a Tribute Page' challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). We were able to use [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) to open the original FreeCodeCamp link (above) that we were issued with and then fork the code; allowing a clone template to be created. This was then used to create a new and unique tribute page about any person of our own choosing. I chose to base my project on a man known as, Hanshi Steve Arneil.  

## Why did I choose this subject?

Hanshi Arneil is now sadly deceased, but he was (and even in death, still is) the highly respected founder of the BKK (British Karate Kyokushinkai) organisation. I've personally practiced and experienced over 10 years of this particular martial art, so I therefore felt it held a very relevant purpose to this exercise. Unfortunately, through injuries, I have now since had to leave martial arts behind, but I'll always be a karateka at heart!

## What have I learnt during this process?

* I can now use Markdown properly to create a better _**README**_ page than I ever would've done before.
* That there's a constant importance in refreshing my understanding towards the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and how to design a basic web page by using these skills.
* That I'm more rusty than I thought when it comes to my use of git inside the command-line of Terminal, although, this is slowly but surely coming back to me.

## My reflections on the journey so far

I'm loving getting back to grips with many of the things I'd previously learned during an online Udemy web development course I once worked on. I've found the School of Code Bootcamp pre-course resources and links really beneficial and in particular I enjoyed the Line Commander challenge/game. There was plenty that I hadn't realised was possible about how to use git to navigate a file structure far more efficiently. I can't wait to learn so much more during the next several months of the course!

## The user story requirements for this assignment
_(All of the following had to be fulfilled for this piece of work to be considered complete):_  

Inside the FreeCodeCamp template there was also an inbuilt testing tool that indicated how successful you had been. This worked by checking whether or not the required, listed user stories had been fully and accurately implemented within the code of your own tribute page. The only way to pass the test was to score a 10 out of 10 result.

* User Story #1: Tribute page should have an element with a corresponding _**id="main"**_, which contains all other elements.
* User Story #2: An element should be seen with a corresponding _**id="title"**_, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
* User Story #3: Should be able to see either a _**figure**_ or a _**div**_ element with a corresponding _**id="img-div"**_.
* User Story #4: Within the _**img-div**_ element, there should be an _**img**_ element with a corresponding _**id="image"**_.
* User Story #5: Within the _**img-div**_ element, an element should be seen with a corresponding _**id="img-caption"**_ that contains textual content describing the image shown in _**img-div**_.
* User Story #6: Should see an element with a corresponding _**id="tribute-info"**_, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
* User Story #7: Should see an _**a**_ element with a corresponding _**id="tribute-link"**_, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: This element must be given an attribute of _**target**_ and be set to _**_blank**_ in order for the link to open in a new tab (i.e. _**target="_blank"**_).
* User Story #8: The _**img**_ element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
* User Story #9: The _**img**_ element should be centered within its parent element.  

## Please enjoy!
